webmakers-tumblr
================

This is the repo for the template for mozillawebmaker.tumblr.com.

Edits made to this template need to be pasted into the "custom HTML" editor in Tumblr itself to take effect.

Best practice is to set up a separate staging Tumblr to make sure everything is working right before going to the live site.

To set up staging Tumblr
-------------------------
* make a new Tumblr site
* go to "customize theme" and set the background color to #EEF0F1, the background image to webmaker-bg.jpg, and the header to webmaker-logo-wordmark-64x64.png
* under "description" add the phrase: Showcasing awesome stuff people are making on the web.
* click "Edit HTML" under the theme section.
* select the entire theme in the editor and delete it. 
* copy the HTML from webmaker-template.html
* paste it into the theme editor. 
* save
* you've got a perfect clone to work with now.
